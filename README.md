# Portfolio Website

## Overview

This repository contains the code for my portfolio website, developed as part of the EWEB ‚Äì Web Engineering module in school. As an UI/UX Designer and Frontend Developer, this portfolio serves as a showcase of my career, skills, and projects. Below is an overview of the technologies I used, the project evolution, and my design considerations. 

I hand-coded my portfolio to maintain precise control over the design, reflecting my continuous learning in the field of programming and my commitment to developing my craft. This choice minimizes dependencies, resulting in a lightweight and efficient website tailored to my personal portfolio's specific needs.

## Technology Used

### Version Control and Hosting
- **GitHub:** I used GitHub for version control and hosting. It serves as a centralized platform for managing code versions and hosting the live portfolio.

### Design and Prototyping
- **Figma:** I used Figma for designing and prototyping the website. Figma allowed for efficient visualization of the project.

### Frontend Development
- **HTML:** The structure of the website is built using HTML to ensure a well-organized and semantically meaningful layout.
- **SCSS:** Styles are written in SCSS to enhance maintainability and enable the use of variables, mixins and nested rules.
- **JavaScript:** Used for adding interactivity and dynamic elements to the website, enhancing the user experience.

### Build, Compilation and Live Preview
- **Prepros:** I utilized Prepros for compiling SCSS into CSS, automating the build process, and efficiently managing assets. Additionally, I used Prepros for live previewing my portfolio website.

### Code Editor
- **Visual Studio Code:** I've chosen Visual Studio Code as my code editor for its powerful features, extensions, and a robust development environment.

### Code Assistance
- **ChatGPT:** I utilized ChatGPT for assistance with complex tasks, incorporating my own adjustments. It provided valuable insights and guidance during the development process.

### External Elements 
- **Bootstrap:** Although I created all the images and icons myself, I opted to include the envelope icon in the footer from the Bootstrap Icon Library for a change.

### Browser
- **Google Chrome:** I tested the website primarily on Google Chrome for compatibility and a consistent experience. Also, for checking how it looked on other breakpoints to assist with the media query coding part.

### Code Structure
- **BEM (Block Element Modifier):** I followed BEM methodology for naming CSS classes, providing a clear and maintainable structure to the code.

## Project Evolution

This repository represents the second iteration of my portfolio. The first repository [here](https://github.com/notaira/portfolio) served as a playground and draft. You can have a look a the website [here](https://notaira.github.io/portfolio/).

## Design Approach

While the mobile-first approach is often recommended, I opted for a desktop-first design strategy. This decision was influenced by the target audience, aiming to showcase this portfolio to my module teacher and peers in class who are likely to view the site on larger screens. This approach allowed for a more immersive and detailed presentation of projects.

### Guidelines and Layout 
The website adheres to a visible guideline and maintains a consistent layout, emphasizing the color palette and typography.

### Color Palette
The color palette revolves around simplicity, with black and white as the primary colors. Pink is introduced as a secondary color, strategically applied to accentuate certain elements and create visual interest.

### Typography Emphasis
To enhance the visual appeal, I paid considerable attention to typography. The design solution prioritizes presenting information in an attractive and engaging manner. Thoughtful font choices, sizes, and spacing contribute to a well-balanced and aesthetically pleasing layout, along with subtle animations and transitions.

This intentional emphasis on typography aims to create a memorable and user-friendly experience, ensuring that content is not only informative but also visually appealing.

## Responsive Design

Although not initially designed with mobile-first principles, the website and its design are responsive. Tested resolutions include:
- 414px x 896px (Apple iPhone 11)
- 1'180px x 820px (Apple iPad Air, 5th Generation)
- 1'280px x 800px (Apple MacBook Air, M2)

The choice of these specific resolutions was based on the availability of devices for testing. In a small project like this, it made sense to optimize for the devices at hand.
